# Bubble_sort
## The Odin Project assignment
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

For recursive bubble sorting i've tried making it alone but i've ended up taking as reference the Javascript method used in this page
